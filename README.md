# Spring_Boot_Backend_for_E_commerce
This is a backend application built using Spring Boot from the Spring Framework. It uses the H2 in-memory database for simplicity and leverages Spring Data JPA for easy data handling. Weâ€™ve also used Lombok to reduce boilerplate code and make development faster and more efficient.
